# David-Houseknecht

This repository holds the static angular project that is hosted on my [github pages](https://djhouseknecht.github.io/david-houseknecht/). 

## Deployment
It uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to continually deploy the build project every time anything is pushed into the `master` branch. I got most of the information I needed to use Travis CI from [this](https://blog.angularindepth.com/the-angular-devops-series-ct-ci-with-travis-ci-and-github-pages-3c02664f078) blog post. 

## Testing 
I don't have tests for this project because it is just static content. If I start adding business logic, I will start writing some unit tests.
