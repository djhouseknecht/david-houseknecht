	<h2>Skills I Would Love To Learn</h2>
	<app-spacer class="w-50"></app-spacer>
	Unfortunately, I don’t have the time necessary to study and learn all the new technologies I would like to. A few that
	I would really like to get into are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Swift and iOS Development:</strong> I have always wanted to get into mobile development, and I enjoy using
			my iPhone. Also my experience in frontend development has given me a great appreciation for user experience (UX).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Node.js:</strong> I am familiar with JavaScript and backend development. I would love to learn more and get
			into developing backends using Node.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>DevOps:</strong> I currently use Docker, Atlassian’s Bamboo build server, and RedHat’s OpenShift deployment
			platform to write build plans to test and deploy applications. I would love to get more involved and learn more
			about DevOps and fine tuning my skills of servers and deployment processes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>NoSQL Data Structures:</strong> I have worked with Google’s Firebase a little bit for a school project. I
			think NoSQL schemas are really interesting and powerful in the proper use case. I would love to dive in deep to
			learn about NoSQL databases.
		</li>
	</ul>
	I am also always eager to learn more about the technologies that I already have experience in. I believe a developer
	always has something new to learn regardless of their experience level.
