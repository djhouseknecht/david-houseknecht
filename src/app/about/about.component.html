	<h2>Passion for Technology</h2>
	<app-spacer class="w-50"></app-spacer>
	<p>
		I am so thankful to have the opportunity to be a software developer. With new technologies constantly emerging, I am
		always eager to learn them while still honing in my skills of technologies I already have experience in. Working in
		an Agile Team environment is something that I highly value, as I enjoy learning from and teaching others. No matter
		what a developerâ€™s skill level, I believe that there is always something new to be learned. I thoroughly enjoy
		writing meaningful applications that are created with user experience at the forefront of design and development, and
		strive to continue this endeavor with all current and future projects.

	<h2>My Software Journey</h2>
	<app-spacer class="w-50"></app-spacer>
	<p>
		My first experience with development was data manipulation and SQL. Ever since then, I am always looking to learn
		more about backend development and database structures. In conjunction with backend development, I have developed a
		passion for writing user interfaces that are intuitive and enjoyable to use. I have such an appreciate for
		applications with quality design and good user experience.

	<h2>Professional Goals</h2>
	<app-spacer class="w-50"></app-spacer>
	<p>
		My goals are to truly master data structures and code design in all areas of my development. I love learning new
		technologies, frameworks, and programming languages. Having expertise in data structures and code design helps reduce
		my learning curve when I get time to pick up something new. It will also help me in my goal to write quality,
		testable code.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		Another goal I have is to become an expert in one or two programming languages which is why I am currently working
		towards my Java certifications through Oracle. Having a solid understanding of an Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
		language will translate to any programming language I get the opportunity to use.
